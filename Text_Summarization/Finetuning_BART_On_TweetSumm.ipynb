Derrick <BR> CoxHelp We still have our original box <BR> Hi, Id like to confirm are you not able to watch any channels at all or please when this message appears? Thanks, Carol <LINK> <BR> CoxHelp I get it when I try to watch stuff on demand. Its not all the time, but most of the time. <BR> Please disconnect the power cord for a full 5 mins.

StarWarsBattlefrontII tesco dissapointedsonafterschool <BR> Tesco <LINK> <BR> Hi Shenman, they should be inside the packaging. Please contact the game creators. They should be able to advise further with it not being inside Allyn <BR> Tesco but as preorder how would retailers know which product to hand out to preorders as all look same? can U shed light? <BR> Tesco can you help? <BR> Hiya, having worked in a store myself, I can tell you that any preorder games come in a separate delivery to the main stock we will sell. This is to avoid those who made a preorder not getting the new game as soon as it is released. TY <BR> Tesco thanks but I checked and they only had one version of the game. No distinction between pre order and regular stock? <BR> Tesco so if I follow the logic here I was given the wrong copy? If your staff new nothing off the promotion which they didnt then they <BR> Tesco may have been giving out the preorder copies to people who were just buying the regular game? Im not trying to be awkward <BR> Tesco but I would just like what I was sold and what I actually paid in advance for. There must be some way of supplying your customers <BR> Tesco correctly. I was told by staff in store that if you order via Direct they email the codes. So surely it must be possible for you to <BR> Tesco supply them to me that way? It would be nice to think Tesco care about resolving things like this for their customers and doing <BR> Tesco what is fair and correct. <BR> Hi there, Ive spoken to my Support Team to confirm, and theyve advised that you would need to speak to EA.
